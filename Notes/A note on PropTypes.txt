As you work through this course you'll see something like import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'; in the code. This has, since publishing this course, been deprecated. If you're using more recent versions you may see an error along the lines of

Warning: checkPropTypes has been moved to a separate package. Accessing React.check PropTypes is no longer supported and will be removed completely in React 16. Use the prop-types package on npm instead. (https://fb.me/migrating-from-react-proptypes).
If you do, have no worries! It's an easy fix. First, from the command line, install prop-types

npm install --save prop-types

Then, anywhere you see me using import React, { PropTypes } from 'react'; go ahead and replace the PropTypes part with import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

Everything else will work fine!
